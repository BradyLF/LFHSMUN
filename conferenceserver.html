		<h1>Our next conference is NUMUN!</h1>
		<a href="http://numun.org">NUMUN.org</a>
		<br>
		<p>Currently in its 13th year of operation, NUMUN convenes annually in April on Northwesternâ€™s beautiful campus. We proudly continue a tradition of Model UN at Northwestern that has continued on and off since 1947 by hosting delegates each year from Chicago, the greater United States, and the entire world.</p>
	        <br>
	        <p>NUMUN offers a unique Model UN experience in an intimate setting where both MUN veterans and newcomers can excel. This year, we will intentionally keep our committees small, ranging from 15-80 delegates, so that delegates have the unparalleled opportunity to participate often and engage deeply with the topics at hand. We pride ourselves on offering traditional, specialized, crisis-oriented, historical, and non-UN committees with exciting topics that are relevant to contemporary affairs. Our staff of approximately 100 talented Northwestern students spend the entire year researching and preparing topics for debate and crises. The fruit of this labor is a fantastic educational experience for our delegates.</p>
	        <br>
	        <p>The conference primarily takes place in the Norris Student Center on the scenic shores of Lake Michigan. Norris offers a variety of dining options, and gives delegates an opportunity to see and experience a functional college campus, rather than a large impersonal hotel. Delegates and advisors are lodged in hotels in downtown Evanston where they are surrounded by a lively town with even more fantastic dining options. We provide buses between Norris and the hotels, although many groups prefer the short 5-15 minute walk from their hotel to the conference in the refreshing weather of Chicago in early spring. Delegates enjoy the experience of visiting a college town, and campus tours of Northwestern are offered to delegates.</p>
